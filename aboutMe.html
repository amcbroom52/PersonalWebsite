        <p class="about-paragraph"> Hi, my name is Adrian McBroom. I'm an aspiring software developer from the Bay Area,
          CA. I started my
          undergrad studies in the fall of 2018 studying mechanical engineering at UC Merced. In my second semester I
          took a coding class, which sparked a heavy interest in coding and computer science for me. After a semester of
          taking both engineering and computer science classes, I decided I wanted to change my major and put all my
          focus into computer science. Two and a half years later, in the fall of 2022, I completed my undergrad studies
          with a Bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering. I'm now looking to take my skills even further
          and continue to learn software and full-stack development.</p>
